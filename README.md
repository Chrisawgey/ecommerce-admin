* MongoDB*: Install MongoDB and make sure it's running on your system. You can download MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com.

* Amazon Web Services (AWS) Account*: Create an AWS account at https://aws.amazon.com and obtain the necessary credentials (access key and secret key) with required permissions to access services like S3, EC2, and RDS.

* Google API Credentials*: Obtain Google API credentials, including API keys for services such as Google Maps, Google Analytics, and OAuth.
